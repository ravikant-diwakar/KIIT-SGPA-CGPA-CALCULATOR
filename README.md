## Calculation Formula

### Credit Point
```
CREDIT POINT = CREDIT × GRADE POINT
```

### Credit Index (CI)
```
CI = ∑(CREDIT POINT) of all courses in a semester
```

### SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)
```
SGPA = CI / ∑CREDITS (for a semester)
```

### CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
```
CGPA = [∑CI of all previous semesters] / [∑CREDITS of all semesters]
```
