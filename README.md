## Calculation Formula

### Credit Point
```
CREDIT POINT = CREDIT Ã— GRADE POINT
```

### Credit Index (CI)
```
CI = âˆ‘(CREDIT POINT) of all courses in a semester
```

### SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)
```
SGPA = CI / âˆ‘CREDITS (for a semester)
```

### CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
```
CGPA = [âˆ‘CI of all previous semesters] / [âˆ‘CREDITS of all semesters]
```
